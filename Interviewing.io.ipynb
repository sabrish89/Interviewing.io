    "<b><u>Some helpful tips:</u><br/>\n",
    "    1. Dont worry about the performance at first, just come up with the simplest, most naive solution you can think of. If you have time, optimize it later.\n",
    "    2. Its helpful to write out your algorithm in pseudocode or in english in the comments/docstring before you start coding. Helps you seperate out the problem solving part from the details of how to write the code. People who do that usually do better.\n",
    "    3. Come up with more test cases if you like since the above is just a small number of them.\n",
    "    4. Lastly as much as possible say what you are thinking while you are working on the problem, cause its helpful for you to know how you are approaching the problem and not just seeing/writing the code.\n",
